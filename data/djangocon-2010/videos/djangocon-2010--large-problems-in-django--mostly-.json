  "description": "This talk is based on my popular series of blog posts highlighting\napplications from the community. I will highlight some of the best\napplications that the Django/Python community has put together, talk\nabout places that are lacking, and talk about what these popular\napplications have in common.\n\nPart 1\n\nI have written a series of blog posts about \"Large problems\" in the\ncommunity, and how they have been solved by members of our community\nwith reusable apps. Previously I have covered:\n\n-  Delayed Execution\n-  Search\n-  APIs\n-  Documentation\n-  Database Migrations\n\nI will update my thoughts on these issues, as well as talking about a\ncouple of other new issues that I think that have been solved in a\ndecent way. These include:\n\n-  Remote Command Execution\n-  Debugging in Development\n-  Continuous Integration\n\nPart 2\n\nIn this part I will highlight issues that are still headaches for the\nCommunity. These are places where there is a good chance for growth for\nthird party apps, and places where I have personally found some friction\nin my development. A couple examples of this are:\n\n-  Deployment\n-  Class Based Views / Thread Safety\n-  Debugging Production Environments\n\nPart 3\n\nFrom the above applications that are well done, what makes a popular\nreusable app? This won't be my thoughts, but more looking at apps that\nhave been successful and trying to see what they have in common. A good\napp and a good reusable app are necessarily different, and I think it\nwill be interesting to look at what traits make reusable apps popular.\n\n`Large problems posts <http://ericholscher.com/tag/largeproblems/>`__\n",
