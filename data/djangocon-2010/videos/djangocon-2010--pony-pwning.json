  "description": "Django's awesomeness unfortunately doesn't make it impenetrable. This\ntalk will cover common pitfalls of the Django developer as seen through\nthe eyes of a hacker or malicious user.\n\nAbstract\n\nDjango is arguably the most secure web framework. The Django team have\ndone an excellent job making secure-by-default decisions for our web\napplications in many situations. Still, the last mile in development is\nwhere the bulk of security vulnerabilities can be introduced and\nDjango's powerful flexibility allows for plenty of rope for developers\nto hang themselves. Understanding the vulnerabilities that can be\ncreated by common mistakes or misconceptions and overlooked details in\ndevelopment will be useful for any Django user.\n",
