  "description": "A look at the large array of database types now available: where each\none excels, why NoSQL isn't always best, and the best ways to integrate\nthem into your Django project.\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the last few years we've seen an explosion in the number of\nproduction- ready databases available for web applications. From\nrelational to document- oriented, key-value and more, there's a\nstaggering array of choice.\n\nThis talk covers the various basic types of database now available, and\nhighlights their weaknesses, their strengths, and the features you just\ncan't get from traditional databases.\n\nThen, after a short rant about the term \"NoSQL\", learn how to best\nintegrate them into your Django projects, why being schemaless isn't as\ngood as it looks at first, and how relational databases are keeping up\nwith the times.\n",
