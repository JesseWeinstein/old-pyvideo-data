  "description": "A panel to discuss the future of no-sql/non-related databases in Django.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe proliferation of non-SQL speaking datastores has caused a lot of\ndiscourse and debate over their potential role in Django's decidedly\nSQL-speaking ORM. The goal of this panel is to consolidate and discuss\nthe root questions of this debate.\n\nThe panel will consist of Django orm contributors and heavy end-users of\nboth Django and a variety of NoSQL database solutions. Questions to the\npanel will briefly cover the NoSQL movement in general and it's staying\npower. After that introduction to the debates at hand outside of Django,\nquestions will shift to focus closely on the issues into integrating\nNoSQL and Django--both on current best practices and future plans for\nintegrating it into the core.\n",
