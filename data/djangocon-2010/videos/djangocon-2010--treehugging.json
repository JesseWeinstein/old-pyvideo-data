  "description": "Hierarchical data sprouts up almost everywhere, but not all trees look\nalike. Learn to how tell them apart and love them all in Django.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk would cover some common examples of hierarchical data in web\napplications and then review solutions like django-mptt and\ndjango-treebeard. Rather than trying to cover tree algorithms in-depth,\nthe focus would be on best practices for querying and rendering trees in\nyour Django apps.\n\nThis talk is not geared for the smart kids; they already know this\nstuff. It is intended to help less experienced developers take advantage\nof patterns without needing to worry about the deeper concepts.\n",
