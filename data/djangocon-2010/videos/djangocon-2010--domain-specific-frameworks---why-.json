  "description": "This talk will provide an overview of some of the existing domain\nspecific frameworks (DSFs) in the Python/Django world, review some of\nthe common patterns used within them, and then explore some things which\ncan be done to make it easier for people to create and maintain DSFs.\n\nAbstract\n\nThere's a growing collection of tools such as Celery, ImageKit, and\nPiston which fall into a weird but wonderful space between utility\nlibraries and full fledged applications. Much like Django, DSFs (domain\nspecific frameworks) provide more structure and have more opinion than\nutility libraries, but remain focused on providing developer instead of\nend-user level functionality. Unlike Django, DSFs focus on solving a\nvery specific set of specific problems.\n\nThis talk will provide an overview of some of the existing DSFs in the\nPython/Django world, review some of the common patterns used within\nthem, and then explore some things which can be done to make it easier\nfor people to create and maintain DSFs. Two of the DSFs to be discussed\ninclude Celery and ImageKit. Some of the patterns to be reviewed include\nregistration, backends, and framework integration/independence. Finally,\nthe future facing discussion will explore possible tools to make DSF\nbuilding easier and steps general purpose frameworks (Django) can take\nto ease integration.\n",
