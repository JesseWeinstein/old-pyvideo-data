However, as a newcomer\nto Django, the prospect of contributing may be somewhat daunting. This\npresentation will show you how to make the transition from user to\ncontributor -- what to do, how to do it, and some guidelines on how to\ndo the job well.\n\nThe aim of this presentation is to explain how we do things in the core,\nand how to work with us to get the job done. It will cover dealing with\nTrac and the triage lifecycle, how to find tickets to triage, other\nnon-obvious ways to contribute, and cover some basic design\nphilosophies.\n",
